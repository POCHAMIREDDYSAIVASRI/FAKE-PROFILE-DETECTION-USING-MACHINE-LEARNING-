Abstract
The rapid growth of social media platforms has led to a significant increase in fake profiles, contributing to threats such as misinformation and identity theft. This study leverages machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest algorithms, to detect fraudulent accounts. The effectiveness of these models is evaluated using datasets obtained from Kaggle, a well-known platform for data science competitions. The datasets consist of user profiles from various social media platforms, carefully labeled as real or fake. Through extensive experimentation and analysis, this study contributes to the development of robust detection systems, enhancing the trust and security of online communities.
